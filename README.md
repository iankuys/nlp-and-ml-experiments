# NLP and ML Experiments: From Trees to Transformers

This repository showcases a hands-on exploration of core machine learning techniques across both traditional and deep learning paradigms. It includes models built using:
- **Decision Trees**
- **Linear Regression**
- **RNN-style modeling with BERT (NLP tasks)**

Built using **PyTorch**, **scikit-learn**, and **HuggingFace Transformers**, this project demonstrates how to apply and compare classical and neural ML models on structured and unstructured datasets.
